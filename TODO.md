# ðŸŽ¯ Learning Journey Tracker â€“ 3D Renderer Development

This file tracks my progress across:
- C++ language foundations (Cherno course)
- OpenGL rendering pipeline (Udemy course)
- My own 3D renderer using SDL2 + OpenGL

---

## ðŸ§± Phase 1: Core C++ (Cherno â€“ `learning.cpp`)
- [X] Functions and headers
- [ ] Classes and objects
- [X] Pointers and memory
- [X] References, const, and value types
- [ ] Data structures (vectors, maps)
- [ ] File organization
- [ ] Build systems (make/CMake basics)

## ðŸ”º Phase 2: OpenGL Concepts (Udemy â€“ `course-opengl/`)
- [ ] GLFW window setup
- [ ] GLEW initialization
- [ ] Drawing a triangle
- [ ] Shaders: Vertex and Fragment
- [ ] VBOs, VAOs, EBOs
- [ ] Model loading with Assimp
- [ ] Camera system
- [ ] Lighting (Phong shading, etc.)

---

## ðŸŒ€ Phase 3: My SDL2 Engine (in `renderer/`)
- [ ] SDL2 window and OpenGL context
- [ ] Input handling (keyboard + mouse)
- [ ] Triangle rendering
- [ ] Shaders and buffers
- [ ] Model loader
- [ ] Camera + physics
- [ ] Interaction and UI (ImGui)

## âœ… Easy Daily Commit Ideas
- [ ] Add a note or idea to this file
- [ ] Check off a box you completed
- [ ] Rename/refactor a function
- [ ] Add comments to explain a block
- [ ] Write a small helper function
- [ ] Update `README.md`
- [ ] Add a dev log (e.g. `log-2025-06-07.md`)
